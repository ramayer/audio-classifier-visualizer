[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/audio-classifier-visualizer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/audio-classifier-visualizer)

A Python library for visualizing audio classifier outputs, including waveforms, spectrograms, and class probabilities over time.

This library was extracted from the [elephant-rumble-inference](https://github.com/ramayer/elephant-rumble-inference) project, which uses deep learning to detect and classify elephant rumble vocalizations in audio recordings.

## Features

- Visualize audio waveforms
- Generate spectrograms with optional color overlays for classification results
- Plot class probabilities over time
- Highly configurable plotting options
- Support for both short and long audio files

## Installation

```console
pip install audio-classifier-visualizer
```
